# MODULE 2 CHALLENGE - Refactor VBA Code and Measure Performance

## Project Overview
This project analyzes stock data from 12 stock tickers; specifically, the analysis compiles the total daily volume and the return generated from each stock over the years 2017 and 2018.


### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to refactor the original code with the intent of increasing the speed (efficiency) by which the VBA script is executed.


## Results
Overall the stock performance in 2017 was strong; all stocks had a positive return, with the exception of TERP which saw a -7.2% return. Comparatively, 2018 stock performance was poor, as all stocks had negative returns witht he exception of ENPH and 
RUN, who posted healthy returns (gretaer than 80%).
