# MODULE 2 CHALLENGE - Refactor VBA Code and Measure Performance

## Project Overview
This project analyzes stock data from 12 stock tickers; specifically, the analysis compiles the total daily volume and the return generated from each stock over the years 2017 and 2018.


### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to refactor the original code with the intent of increasing the speed (efficiency) by which the VBA script is executed.


## Results
The original VBA scrips times are shown below; the scripts for 2017 and 2018 ran in .605 and .613 respectively.

![ORIGINAL All Stocks 2018](

Overall the stock performance in 2017 was strong; all stocks had a positive return, with the exception of TERP which saw a -7.2% return. Comparatively, 2018 stock performance was poor, as all stocks had negative returns witht he exception of ENPH and RUN, who posted healthy returns (greater than 80%). The original code ran in  respectively as shown in the image below.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
